REFACTOR reducers.... so that one action, e.g. 'RESET_GAME' returns new state obj, with necessary changes, rather than dispatching an action for each property of state.

Use React-Redux? With Provider to wrap root element and pass down store via props, and then connect() function.
mapStateToProps,
mapDispatchToProps

Use action creators..?
