Write logic to show sequence one by one and respond to user input.

Write validation logic for user input, does it match the moves sequence?


Add boolean for checking whether user input is allowed (game started, not currently showing last sequence)

Add animation when button is pressed or shown as part of sequence

Add strict mode / lives left for non-strict mode

Style better
